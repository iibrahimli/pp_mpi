When running the program with 1, 2, and 4 processes we observe that the
program correctly sorts the array, but the processing times differ.
Processing time is also dependent on inter-process communicator (in this
case, the network). This leads to some amount of slowdown, which becomes
noticeable when we use a higher number of processes (ex. 4). Here are the
processing times for my experiments:


array size = 65536

1 process:   0.007847 s
2 processes: 0.004683 s
4 processes: 0.005274 s
